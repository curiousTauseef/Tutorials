#PURPOSE: This program finds the masimum number of a 
#         set of data items.
#
#VARIABLES: The registers have the following uses:
#
# %edi - Holds the index of the data item being examined
# %ebx - Largest data item found
# %eax - Current data item
#
# The following memory location are used:
#
# data_items - contains the item data.  A 0 is used
#              to terminate the data
